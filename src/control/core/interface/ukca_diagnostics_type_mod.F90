! --- Parameter definitions ---

! Field group codes for collating diagnostic fields in arrays
! 'flat' group comprises fields defined on a flat spatial grid with 2D
! representation internally (output can have reduced dimension)
! 'fullht' group comprises fields defined on a full height spatial grid with 3D
! representation internally (output can have reduced dimension)
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: dgroup_flat_real = 1     ! 2D spatial real
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: dgroup_fullht_real = 2   ! 3D spatial real

! Number of diagnostic groups
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: n_diag_group = 2

! --- Status flag values for requested diagnostics ---
! The parent can set these to indicate that individual requests should be
! treated as active or inactive.
! Requests are accepted as such if the diagnostic is available in the current
! UKCA configuration. Otherwise they are marked unavailable.
! The status of each active request is updated when serviced or when
! skipped due to non-availability on the current time step.
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: diag_status_inactive = 0
   ! Request set/accepted as inactive
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: diag_status_requested = 1
   ! Request set/accepted as active
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: diag_status_valid = 2
   ! Data provided
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: diag_status_skipped = 3
   ! Data unavailable on current time step
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: diag_status_unavailable = 4
   ! Diagnostic unavailable in UKCA configuration
   ! (request denied)
