! Description:
!   Returns the day of the week (Sunday=1, ..., Saturday=7) given the date.
!
! Method:
!   Based on algorithm from Calendar FAQ, v. 2.6
!   (modified 24 June 2003) Part 1/3
!   http://www.faqs.org/faqs/calendars/faq/part1/index.html
!   Assumes Gregorian calendar
!   a = (14 - month) / 12
!   y = year - a
!   m = month + 12*a - 2
!   d = (day + y + y/4 - y/100 + y/400 + (31*m)/12) mod 7
!   We add 1 to the result so that Sunday=1, ..., Saturday=7. This way
!   we can use it to index arrays with lower and upper bounds equal to
!   1 and 7, respectively.
