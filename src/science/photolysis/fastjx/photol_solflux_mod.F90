!  Routine to calculate solar flux, using average solar flux, the shape
!  of the solar cycle, and the time series of the solar cycle.
!
! Method: A singular value decomposition has been performed on the spectrally
!  resolved solar irradiance data. The data is very well described by the
!  product of a spectrally varying term and a time series. The spectral
!  composition of the solar cycle has been fed through the FAST-JX binning
!  algorithm. Here we compute the product of the spectral signature
!  and the solar cycle time series to infer the spectral variation.
!
!  If i_ukca_solcyc is set to (1) the observational data are used for the time
!  period for which they exist, before and after this time period
!  an average cycle is repeated. The period of this repeated average cycle
!  is 10 years 8 months.
!  If i_ukca_solcyc is set to (2) this average cycle is used at all times.
!
!
!  Part of the UKCA model, a community model supported by
!  The Met Office and NCAS, with components provided initially
!  by The University of Cambridge, University of Leeds and
!  The Met. Office.  See www.ukca.ac.uk
